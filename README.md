<h2>mygovpolicy</h2>

<br/>
A web portal for the people of India wherein they get to know about the government policies that are applicable to them. A peculiar feature is the Aadhar Card linkage in this time when the Indian government is trying to associate everything with Aadhar Card.
Often and on the government launches various policies for the welfare of the people of the country. Still many a times we remain unaware of them. Even if we are aware we sometimes find it hard to figure out how to apply for the same on the correct portal and struggle to find the procedure for the same. This is an initiative to help in this direction. It provides a list of all the policies with their official website and other relevant information to the logged in user. The user needs to sign up with some basic details and his/her Aadhar Card number. Based on the provided information he/she will get a list of the applicable policies as well as the full record of the existing policies by the central government.
